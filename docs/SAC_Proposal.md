## SAC Proposal (Project 1)

### Introduction

1. Tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) are a class of antigenic molecules expressed by tumor cells capable of inducing an adaptive antitumor immune response
2. They are almost exclusively expressed by the tumor cells and constitute neoantigens â€“ novel antigens expressed by the tumor cells as a result of various tumor-specific alterations, such as nonsynonymous single nucleotide mutations or short genomic insertions or deletions (indels), gene fusions, 
3. Neoantigens are more likely to be highly immunogenic to the patient's immune system and may elicit stronger tumor-specific immune response

[There is a link between tumor mutational burden (TMB) and neoantigen load but...]

[ Cancer neoantigens have traditionally been studied in the context of single nucleotide mutations in coding regions, in particular in the exome. But a large portion of TMB also include mutations in noncoding regions of the genome, as well as other processes such as aberrant splicing events (ASE) and RNA editing. These proceesses may produce a set of neoantigens that can be unique to a particular tumor cell.]

[The idea of personalized neoantigen-based vaccine is exciting but logistically daunting and focusing research efforts on discovering shared immunogenic tumor-specific neoantigens that can be used to aid immunothrapy for a specific cancer occurring within a specific population of patinets may be more realistic and achievable.]

[A neoantigen database, specifically one that collates neoantigen data from sources beyond SN mutations and indels of coding regions of the genome, would fill in the literature gap and diversify current neoantigen-based therapeutic development. We also attempt to contextualize genomic data obtained from local cohort of patients in Malaysia to create a more direct therapeutic impact and contribute back to the local community, both in general and in cancer clinical context.]
